We can say that on average, customers last shopped about 3 months ago, made around 92 purchases and spent about 2054. There are some customers who shop and spend a lot more than others. We can say half of the customers last shopped about 50 days ago, made around 41 purchases and spent about 674. We should focus on big spenders as this could be really valuable to the business.\n"
